# A blockchain-based Medical Records Management System

Today, doctors & health professionals are limited in the level of care they can provide because due to inability to view your complete, accurate health records. The proposed solution is a blockchain network created by the Health Department, who registers the doctors in this network. The doctors can publish patients medical records safely on blockchain network.

# System Requirements
Operating System : Ubuntu 16.04
System RAM : 4GB or Above

Step 1: Login as admin to register the doctors. Admin has the privilege to register or delist the doctors.

Step 2: Only registered doctors can add health records of patients. The patient registration will be done at this point of time.

Step 3: Only registered patients can access the patient login portal. The registered patients can view their health records history. Also the patients can view the health records w.r.t respective doctors.

Step 4: Only patients has the privilege to grant access to doctor, so that the doctor can view the respective patients health records for a particular period. The patients can revoke the access given to doctor at any point of time.
